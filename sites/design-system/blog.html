        </h3>
        <p class="lead">
            We've created <a href="https://design-systems-ihsm.slack.com/">a new Slack channel for the Design Systems Team called design-systems-ihsm</a>.
        </p>

        <h4>Wait, &hellip; What happened to the old one?</h4>
        <p>
            In our efforts to improve our communication we previously created <a href="https://ihspdd.slack.com/archives/C6SL4EHD1">a slack channel for this purpose for which many of you signed up</a>. At the time we thought it was the best idea to create it under the PD&amp;D group's Slack channel as a sub-channel. At this point we've learned our lesson and have to get off.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>The first problem:</strong> Some people were able to join the PD&amp;D group's slack channel using their "@ihsmarkit.com" email address and others were not. The one's that couldn't needed administrative help from the Slack channel's administrator's that they weren't available to give.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>The second problem:</strong> The group making the most use of the PD&amp;D group channel is moving to a paid Slack account where they will have to pay for each user in their channel. This group is not budgeted to pay for the additional users we brought in.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>The bottom line:</strong> We need to get our own channel. We're sorry for the confusion and hassle this has caused.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will likely let the old channel sit dormant for a month or two until people fully transition over before we delete it.
        </p>

        <br />
        <h4>So we created our own Slack channels</h4>
        <p>
            <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/design-systems-ihsm/shared_invite/enQtMjYxNDkyNDQwOTMyLWJhNmYxZTExZTBmNjQ2MjBmZTYzZTJmY2FiMzBlYTc2ZGJiYzllZDI0MmIzYzQzNTAyMmM1ZjJlOWJhZjdmMDQ" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg btn-block">
                Join our new design-systems-ihsm main Slack channel
            </a>
        </p>
        <p>
            We've created new Slack channels and a number of sub-channels. We hope you'll join the public ones that interest you. These public channels *should* allow anyone using their "@ihsmarkit.com" email address to join. We hope we got the configuration right this time. If you encounter problems contact me and I'll get you invited and signed up somehow.
        </p>
        <p class="color-info-text">
            <strong>Note:</strong> Be aware that Slack creates and maintains a unique username and password for each Slack channel you join. So far people have been having the best luck joining through the Slack installed application (Windows and Mac) instead of using the web browser application to join. Please give it a try before you ask for my help.

        </h3>
        <p class="lead">
            We are very happy to announce that the <em class="product-title"><abbr title="the CssPatternLibrary 3 design system">CPL3</abbr></em> version 2.0.0 was released today! This major release includes the creation of a new IHS Markit theme and the scoping changes mentioned in our previous blog posts.
        </p>

        <h4>New IHS Markit theme</h4>
        <p>
            We've been working hard on creating a new IHS Markit branded theme for our <em class="product-title"><abbr title="the CssPatternLibrary 3 design system">CPL3</abbr></em> customers to start using. Our new IHS Markit theme which we have named the "<abbr title="IHS Markit">IHSM</abbr> theme" will become the main theme of the <em class="product-title"><abbr title="the CssPatternLibrary 3 design system">CPL3</abbr></em> from today moving forward.
        </p>

        <h5>What themes are now available?</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <abbr title="IHS Markit">IHSM</abbr> theme - "styles-nw-ihsm.css"
            </li>
            <li>
                Default theme - "styles-nw.css"
            </li>
            <li>
                IHS theme -  "styles-nw-ihs.css"
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h5>What's happening to the old IHS theme?</h5>
        <p>
            Our intent is to leave the IHS theme alone and sunset its use over a transition period of the next 2 to 3 months (or 4 to 6 minor releases of the <em class="product-title"><abbr title="the CssPatternLibrary 3 design system">CPL3</abbr></em> npm package in other words). A specific file in our package called "styles-nw-ihs.css" has now been created that contains the IHS theme. The styles in our default stylesheet named "styles-nw.css" will continue to be the IHS theme styles for a short transition period after which we will change them to start using the new <abbr title="IHS Markit">IHSM</abbr> theme. <span class="text-warning">Please use this transition time to prepare your project to move fully onto the <abbr title="IHS Markit">IHSM</abbr> theme.</span>
        </p>

        <h5>How do we use the new <abbr title="IHS Markit">IHSM</abbr> theme?</h5>
        <p>
            The new <abbr title="IHS Markit">IHSM</abbr> theme is directly available in the newly created "styles-nw-ihsm.css" file. After the transition period we will override the default styles in the "styles-nw.css" file with the <abbr title="IHS Markit">IHSM</abbr> theme styles from the "styles-nw-ihsm.css" file. Choose the option that best works for you.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Use the "styles-nw-ihsm.css" directly because you're ready for <abbr title="IHS Markit">IHSM</abbr> styles.
            </li>
            <li>
                Continue to use the "styles-nw.css" to get the IHS styles today and automatically change over to the <abbr title="IHS Markit">IHSM</abbr> styles when they become the default.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stick with the IHS styles by specifically linking to the "styles-nw-ihs.css" file. You'll change to the <abbr title="IHS Markit">IHSM</abbr> styles when you're ready. (But make sure it is before we remove them from our package!)
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h5>Will the IHS theme styles go away?</h5>
        <p>
            Yes, they will. At some point we will remove them from our package and cease to maintain them or offer support. We haven't set a hard date for this yet but we expect it will likely be coming with our next major release or a period of 6 months or less - whichever comes first. We will communicate our intentions as soon as it becomes clear what our best course of action is. Please voice any concerns you have on this topic early so we can work with you toward an appropriate resolution.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the "styles-nw-ihs.css" file is removed from our package there will no longer be a need to distinguish between themes. Thus, we expect to remove the styles-nw-ihsm.css" file as well and simply return to using the "styles-nw.css" file exclusively.
        </p>

        <h5>Let's see it in action</h5>
        <p class="text-info">
            Click away &hellip; it's fun! Go ahead and give it a try by clicking the theme you want from our new Theme Switcher in the top right corner of the site header. Doing this will also show you what things have changed from one theme to the next.

        </h3>
        <p class="text-warning"><span class="label label-primary">Required</span> <span class="label label-warning">Breaking change</span> The scoping class <code>cpl-scope</code> is now required in version 2.0.0 going forward.</p>
        <p>
            This change is a strong "line-in-the-sand" kind of change. Once you've updated to version 2.0.0 of the csspatternlibrary3 npm package you will only get our styles within the scoped area of your HTML that has the scoping class <code>cpl-scope</code>. Any HTML outside of this scope will no longer be affected. Any project that updates without making the change will be in a "broken" state.
        </p>

        <h3>Who should update?</h3>
        <p>
            Projects or applications that meet some of the following criteria are good candidates to immediately update:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Smaller projects where it would be easy to meet our "Post update requirements" noted below
            </li>
            <li>
                You're simply adding the <code>cpl-scope</code> class to the <code>html</code> or <code>body</code> tags - something like <code>&lt;html class="cpl-scope"></code>
            </li>
            <li>
                Your project uses all of <em class="product-title"><abbr title="the CssPatternLibrary 3 design system">CPL3</abbr></em> and you can make a small change to your "master page" or outer-most template (usually the "index.html" file) which will quickly get you back into a "working" state.
            </li>
            <li>
                You've planned and scheduled to be ready to take on this update.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Who should NOT update until they are ready?</h3>
        <p>
            Projects or applications that have any of the following issues are probably not ready to update until preparations are made:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Development resources are already committed to other needs within your project and cannot be freed-up to make the necessary changes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Your project is large or complicated. Thus, making this change needs planning.
            </li>
            <li>
                You need to pick and choose where to add the <code>cpl-scope</code> class within your project's HTML
            </li>
            <li>
                Your project only uses pieces of <em class="product-title"><abbr title="the CssPatternLibrary 3 design system">CPL3</abbr></em> and you need to evaluate before proceeding.
            </li>
            <li>
                You're NOT YET planned, scheduled, or otherwise ready to take on this update. You don't yet know what the impact of it will be on your project. You don't yet know how or where you will be making the changes to add the scoping class <code>cpl-scope</code> to your code.
            </li>
        </ol>
    
        <h3>Post update requirements</h3>
        <p>After updating to csspatternlibrary3 version 2.0.0 and going forward:</p>
        <p>    
            To use our library of styles you must add what we're calling a scoping class to your code. Add a <code>cpl-scope</code> class to the parent element of any sections of your site or application that should receive <em class="product-title"><abbr title="the CssPatternLibrary 3 design system">CPL3</abbr></em> styles. HTML not contained within this class will no longer be effected in any way by the <em class="product-title"><abbr title="the CssPatternLibrary 3 design system">CPL3</abbr></em>.
            
            <br /><br />
            We expect most will simply add this class to the root html element like <code>&lt;html class="cpl-scope"></code>.
            
            <br /><br />
            If you need to add it elsewhere please make sure that it is added to an html element of its own like <code>&lt;div class="cpl-scope"></code>
            
            <br /><br />
            DO NOT ADD IT TO HTML ELEMENTS THAT ALREADY HAVE EXISTING CPL-SPECIFIC CLASSES like <code>&lt;div class="row cpl-scope"></code> because doing so will give unexpected results.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Why was this change made?</h3>
        <p>
            See our previous roadmap blog post titled "Major customer complaints, issues, and our plan for action" for more details. Additionally, we know that our package is already on the "bloated" side of things. After evaluating &hellip; this solution was chosen because it offers the best path for continuing to trim down the weight of our package while also offering (what we thought was) an acceptable amount of flexibility to those customers that update. This path did not force us to increase the weight of our core stylesheet ("styles-nw.css") by 3 - 6 times which is what our main alternative would have required. That alternative would have provided a more graceful fallback with all the styles mixed in the same stylesheet. Fortunately, our "Transition Options" described below provide most of that graceful fallback with a clear path for removing unused styles when possible.
        </p>

        <h3>Transition Options</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Delay updating to the 2.0.0 version
            </li>
            <li>
                Use both stylesheets from the 1.0.12 and 2.0.0 versions
            </li>
            <li>
                Request special help from the <em class="product-title"><abbr title="the CssPatternLibrary 3 design system">CPL3</abbr></em> team
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Using both stylesheets</h4>
        <p>If you cannot make all the changes necessary to fully update to version 2.0.0 but need to apply it piece-meal to your project consider using both stylesheets. The stylesheet ("styles-nw.css") from version 1.0.12 will allow your project's already working code to continue to work (as it did in version 1.0.12). The stylesheet ("styles-nw.css") from version 2.0.0 will override version 1.0.12 styles whenever a scoping class is appropriately applied.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span class="label label-success">Pro</span> Smooth transition while the update is being integrated.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="label label-warning">Con</span> Your project will incur the weight of both stylesheets until the 1.0.12 styles can be removed.

            We are currently updating <em class="product-title"><abbr title="the CssPatternLibrary 3 design system">CPL3</abbr></em> daily to get this website up to date. We’re improving the documentation and trying to fix the numerous bugs and broken bits. Major broken items like the “Full Documentation” link in the left rail navigation are definite “black-eyes” for us that we’re trying to fix ASAP, but we do have other higher priorities that are being worked on to meet business needs. This is good news for you because those business needs likely match up with what you want out of the <em class="product-title"><abbr title="the CssPatternLibrary 3 design system">CPL3</abbr></em>.
        </p>
        <h3>Roadmap</h3>
        <p>
            The immediate (over the next 1 - 3 weeks) roadmap includes:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Removing <em class="product-title"><abbr title="the CssPatternLibrary 3 design system">CPL3</abbr></em> leaking styles by scoping the styles of the <em class="product-title"><abbr title="the CssPatternLibrary 3 design system">CPL3</abbr></em>. This will limit <em class="product-title"><abbr title="the CssPatternLibrary 3 design system">CPL3</abbr></em> styles to affecting only HTML elements with the <code>cpl-scope</code> class applied. The children elements of this HTML element will of course also be styled by <em class="product-title"><abbr title="the CssPatternLibrary 3 design system">CPL3</abbr></em>. See the notes below in the customer complaints section for more information.
            <li>
                Updating the <em class="product-title"><abbr title="the CssPatternLibrary 3 design system">CPL3</abbr></em> to have both IHS and IHS Markit branding available.
            </li>
            <li>
                Start offering the <em class="product-title"><abbr title="the CssPatternLibrary 3 design system">CPL3</abbr></em> via <abbr title="Content Delivery Network">CDN</abbr>
            </li>
            <li>
                Start again with regular updates and communication
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        We’re shooting to update the npm package on a regular basis of every other Friday – starting with our first target of October 13<sup>th</sup>, 2017 as the first update that makes IHS Markit branding available.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The website will update as often as possible as we make fixes and lay out our roadmap. This will make it the best place to get info on the <em class="product-title"><abbr title="the CssPatternLibrary 3 design system">CPL3</abbr></em> (other than contacting me directly, but I’ll be doing my best to keep information and communication on the website up to date).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We’ve created a slack channel to improve communication. The one we created has run into some technical issues that may necessitate that we create another. We’ll be posting information about it to the website ASAP. The goal is to allow anyone that has an “@ihsmarkit.com” type of email to join the channel. This is currently working for some and not for others – thus the possible need to make a change.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We’ll also be starting up regular “office hours” forum meetings via WebEx soon. This will set up a regularly scheduled forum for <em class="product-title"><abbr title="the CssPatternLibrary 3 design system">CPL3</abbr></em> users (customers) to ask any questions and get personal help as they need it. We’ll also be discussing roadmap changes here to make sure we’re planning to deliver what our customers need. Please <a href="mailto:Michael.Witt@ihsmarkit.com">contact me</a> if you want to be included or notified about this meeting.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                Bookmarkable URLs on <em class="product-title"><abbr title="the CssPatternLibrary 3 design system">CPL3</abbr></em> site
            </li>
            <li>
                Fix the Patterns section of the <em class="product-title"><abbr title="the CssPatternLibrary 3 design system">CPL3</abbr></em> site so that code snippets are once again present. This will make it easy for developers to copy the patterns they need and paste them into their projects.
            </li>
            <li>
                Numerous bug fixes and small updates to the website
            </li>
            <li>
                Start the process of removing direct dependency on the Twitter Bootstrap and jQuery. See the explanation below for more details on why we're making this change and how it will affect you.

                            <li>
                                The current implementation of <em class="product-title"><abbr title="the CssPatternLibrary 3 design system">CPL3</abbr></em> is close to a standard version of the Twitter Bootstrap with IHS branding colors applied and a few minor tweaks to the styles. The <em class="product-title"><abbr title="the CssPatternLibrary 3 design system">CPL3</abbr></em> mostly offers CSS types of benefits at the moment and our JavaScript is essentially straight from Bootstrap. The <em class="product-title"><abbr title="the CssPatternLibrary 3 design system">CPL3</abbr></em> also offers a few patterns and components that are unique to the <em class="product-title"><abbr title="the CssPatternLibrary 3 design system">CPL3</abbr></em>, but not many.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                This is a major concern that the majority of our current customers (and most notably our potential new customers) would like us to address.
                                <ol>
                                    <li>
                                        <span class="label label-info">Action</span> 
                                        Thus, we have started work to “scope” the entirety of <em class="product-title"><abbr title="the CssPatternLibrary 3 design system">CPL3</abbr></em> styles to only apply to HTML that is nested within an HTML element with the class name of <code>cpl-scope</code>. In many cases this can be as easy as adding the <code>cpl-scope</code> class to the root level <code>html</code> element of your project (something like <code>&lt;html class=”cpl-scope”></code>).
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span class="label label-warning">Breaking change</span> 
                                        Existing projects that use the <em class="product-title"><abbr title="the CssPatternLibrary 3 design system">CPL3</abbr></em> will have to add the <code>cpl-scope</code> class somewhere in their HTML to continue to be affected by the <em class="product-title"><abbr title="the CssPatternLibrary 3 design system">CPL3</abbr></em>'s styles. This will be necessary from the October 13<sup>th</sup>, 2017 npm package release moving forward. Our hope is that this change can even be made by developers in advance of updating the npm package used in their project as it will likely have no effect until the update is made. Then the update should come off without a hitch.
                                    </li>

                                        <span class="label label-warning">Breaking change</span> 
                                        Doing this requires us to break our current ability to work with any version 3.x implementation of the Twitter Bootstrap. This is because most of the styles that are leaking out are actually coming from Bootstrap styles. This will mean that we will start encouraging our customers to link to the version of the Twitter Bootstrap that is included in our npm package. Most of our customers are already doing this and do not have specific needs above the version of Bootstrap that is we include. Please let us know if your project has additional needs or concerns around this limitation. Our hope is to ramp up development progress to the point that our offering out-paces Bootstrap improvements and better meets your needs with the customizations that you specifically need.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>

                                        This work is mostly complete and working on our Dev site. The plan is to release it as part of the upcoming October 13<sup>th</sup> npm package release. Thus, <em class="product-title"><abbr title="the CssPatternLibrary 3 design system">CPL3</abbr></em> customers will need to start using the version of Bootstrap included in the <em class="product-title"><abbr title="the CssPatternLibrary 3 design system">CPL3</abbr></em> to get this benefit. Linking to another version of Bootstrap will likely continue to work (with the side-effect of leaking styles) for a little while, but the changes that we make from this point forward will likely start causing issues at some point. We expect to provide support for this issue and plan to address these issues with all of our customers (helping teams make the necessary changes) over the next 2 to 6 months. If this issue causes problems for your project please stop updating as new <em class="product-title"><abbr title="the CssPatternLibrary 3 design system">CPL3</abbr></em> versions are released, use the latest version of the <em class="product-title"><abbr title="the CssPatternLibrary 3 design system">CPL3</abbr></em> that you can without issues, and contact Michael Witt for help in resolving your issues.

                                                        Only the simplest layouts work well out of the box. Most require serious tweaking to get right.

                                                Bootstrap’s naming conventions that provide functionality on a base (<code>.alert</code>) and modifier (<code>.alert-success</code>) class basis.

                                                A core set of Bootstrap Components that can be used as building blocks in the construction of more complex components, patterns, and applications.

                                                Lots of documentation, tools, and information on the internet about working with Bootstrap.

                                                Less files are available – developers have direct access to Less mixins and other advanced tooling built into Bootstrap if needed

                                            <li>
                                                Adds Bootstrap’s flexibility

                        We’re planning a structured change away from direct dependency on Bootstrap

                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                We’re going further than Bootstrap ever intended to go. Enhancing, improving, trimming down, refining, and otherwise breaking away from the limitations of Bootstrap.

                                <br /><br />
                                We will make every effort to maintain as much compatibility with the Twitter Bootstrap as possible. We will hold open discussions before making these changes so that their negative impact can be reduced, eliminated, or otherwise negotiated with our customers. We expect to find a way to work with you that still allows us to move forward.
                                
                                <br /><br />
                                Customer feedback is a major driver for where we expect to go with this. Please voice any concerns you have so that we may act accordingly.

                                        We’re keeping:

                                            <li>
                                                Ability to (optionally) use Bootstrap layout grids (if they’re a good fit for your project). We expect to add the option to choose other layout grid systems as alternatives.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Most of the benefits of developer’s knowledge of Bootstrap:

                                                        Backwards compatibility with Bootstrap’s classes and ids. Exceptions will be noted on website

                                                        Bootstrap’s naming conventions for base and modifier classes.

                                                        Core Bootstrap (based) components – possibly enhanced, improved, trimmed down, tested, etc.

                                        We’re removing, replacing, or reducing:
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>
                                                Removing direct dependency on Twitter Bootstrap
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Removing direct dependency on jQuery – all jQuery specific JavaScript will be rewritten in vanilla JavaScript
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Paring down core styles so that they need to be overridden less and add less weight to the <em class="product-title"><abbr title="the CssPatternLibrary 3 design system">CPL3</abbr></em>
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Reducing the need to bring in the whole Bootstrap library – moving toward an “a-la-carte” type of use case.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Replacing Bootstrap’s styles related to spacing. They are not consistent or well designed. Our design will create a standard that we will use throughout the <em class="product-title"><abbr title="the CssPatternLibrary 3 design system">CPL3</abbr></em>. This standard should be easy for your developers and designers to remember and apply.
                                            </li>

                                        Expected additional benefits:
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>
                                                Speed and file size improvements
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Better look and feel - stronger branding, more unified, more flexible
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Easier for us to improve the <em class="product-title"><abbr title="the CssPatternLibrary 3 design system">CPL3</abbr></em>
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Improved framework for applying and understanding spacing in <em class="product-title"><abbr title="the CssPatternLibrary 3 design system">CPL3</abbr></em> designs – padding, margin, border sizes, line-heights, white-space use, etc.
                                            </li>
                                        </ol>
