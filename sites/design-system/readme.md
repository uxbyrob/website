### Usage

The css pattern library is based on Bootstrap.

Bootstrap css is included in the styles.css file. **You do NOT need to import bootstrap css separately.**

Include bootstrap.js (or min) if you need the interactive bootstrap widgets.

IHS Pattern javascript files are available in the js folder and can be included as needed.
